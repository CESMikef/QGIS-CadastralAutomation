# Progress Feedback Guide

## Overview

The Cadastral Automation plugin provides comprehensive progress feedback during processing to keep users informed about what's happening.

## Progress Indicators

### 1. Progress Dialog

When you click **OK** to start processing, a progress dialog appears showing:

- **Window Title**: "Cadastral Automation"
- **Progress Bar**: Visual indicator of completion (0-100%)
- **Status Message**: Current processing step
- **Cancel Button**: Allows you to abort processing at any time

### 2. Processing Steps

#### Cadastral Mode (7 steps + 2):
1. "Running in CADASTRAL MODE - creating individual cadastrals"
2. "Reprojecting layers to target CRS..."
3. "Buffering roads by [X]m..."
4. "Creating Voronoi polygons from points..."
5. "Subtracting road reserves from cadastrals..."
6. "Filtering by area ([min]-[max] m²)..."
7. "Cadastrals created: [N] features"
8. "Saving to [path]..."
9. "Finalizing..."

#### Blocks Mode (4 steps + 2):
1. "Running in BLOCKS MODE - creating outer boundaries only"
2. "Buffering roads and creating blocks..."
3. "Filtering by area ([min]-[max] m²)..."
4. "Blocks created: [N] features"
5. "Saving to [path]..."
6. "Finalizing..."

### 3. QGIS Message Bar

After successful completion, a green success message appears at the top of the QGIS window:

```
✓ Success: Cadastrals generated: [N] features created
```

This message automatically disappears after 5 seconds.

### 4. Message Log

Detailed progress messages are logged to the QGIS message log panel:

**To view:**
1. Go to `View > Panels > Log Messages`
2. Look for the "Cadastral Automation" tab

**Log entries include:**
- Processing start/end markers
- Each processing step
- Feature counts
- File paths
- Any errors or warnings

### 5. Success Dialog

After processing completes, a dialog box shows:

```
✓ Success

Cadastrals generated successfully!

Features created: [N]
Saved to: [path]
```

## Cancelling Processing

You can cancel processing at any time:

1. Click the **Cancel** button in the progress dialog
2. Processing will stop immediately
3. An error message will appear: "Processing cancelled by user"
4. No output file will be created

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during processing:

1. The progress dialog closes automatically
2. An error message appears in the QGIS message bar (red)
3. A detailed error dialog shows what went wrong
4. Full error details are logged to the message log

## Tips

### Monitor Progress
- Keep the progress dialog visible to see what step is running
- Check the message log for detailed information
- Watch the progress bar to estimate completion time

### Large Datasets
For large datasets (>10,000 points):
- Processing may take several minutes
- The progress dialog will update at each step
- Don't close QGIS while processing is running
- Consider processing smaller areas if it takes too long

### Troubleshooting
If the progress dialog appears to freeze:
- Check the message log - processing may still be running
- QGIS processing algorithms don't always update progress smoothly
- Wait for the current step to complete
- Use the Cancel button if needed

## Example Progress Flow

### Small Dataset (1,000 points)
```
[0%  ] Initializing...
[14% ] Running in CADASTRAL MODE - creating individual cadastrals
[28% ] Reprojecting layers to target CRS...
[42% ] Buffering roads by 10.0m...
[57% ] Creating Voronoi polygons from points...
[71% ] Subtracting road reserves from cadastrals...
[85% ] Filtering by area (250.0-2000.0 m²)...
[100%] Cadastrals created: 847 features
[100%] Saving to C:/output/cadastrals.gpkg...
[100%] Finalizing...
```

**Total time**: ~10-30 seconds

### Large Dataset (10,000 points)
```
[0%  ] Initializing...
[14% ] Running in CADASTRAL MODE - creating individual cadastrals
[28% ] Reprojecting layers to target CRS...
[42% ] Buffering roads by 10.0m...
[57% ] Creating Voronoi polygons from points... (may take 1-2 minutes)
[71% ] Subtracting road reserves from cadastrals... (may take 1-2 minutes)
[85% ] Filtering by area (250.0-2000.0 m²)...
[100%] Cadastrals created: 8,234 features
[100%] Saving to C:/output/cadastrals.gpkg...
[100%] Finalizing...
```

**Total time**: ~2-5 minutes

## UI Responsiveness

The plugin uses `QCoreApplication.processEvents()` to keep the UI responsive during processing:

- ✅ You can move the progress dialog
- ✅ You can click the Cancel button
- ✅ QGIS doesn't appear frozen
- ✅ Other QGIS windows remain accessible

However, avoid:
- ❌ Starting other processing tasks
- ❌ Closing QGIS
- ❌ Removing input layers
- ❌ Modifying input data

## Summary

The progress feedback system ensures you always know:
1. **What** is happening (current step)
2. **How much** is complete (progress bar)
3. **When** it's done (success message)
4. **If** something went wrong (error handling)

This makes the plugin user-friendly and professional, especially for long-running processes!
